This version contains two major changes:

1. The crossover method has been completely changed. This version simply looks at which quadrant contains the target angle and uses the sensor pertaining to that side.
2. The inflation algorithm uses a metered inflation and is designed to slightly overshoot the target, then counterinflate back to it.
